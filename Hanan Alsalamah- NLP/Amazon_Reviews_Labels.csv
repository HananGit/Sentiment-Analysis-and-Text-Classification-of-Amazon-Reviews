"2","I've read all the answers from Brita to the comments posted by unsatisfied customers about the filter NOT staying sealed tightly. I know about first rinsing a new filter in cold water for 15 seconds. I know that you need to line up the filter with the grooves. I know you then push down hard the filter so it locks in place - so called! AFTER HAVING DONE THIS, the filter still pops up a fraction causing water to leak through the sides of said filter. Now, I am 6'5"", 250 lbs. I lift weights 4 days a week. I am not a weak duckling. Yet, time after time, even after pushing down the filter with all my strength, the filter will not stay tightly secured in place. Why there is no rubber ring for added sealment remains a mystery to me. Why they didn't design this to ""screw"" said filter in place so it is water tight (versus just dropping the filter into the pitcher and pushing down), is a mystery to me. And, even when the filter does happen to seal a little tighter than it normally does, as soon as I move the pitcher about (to pour water for example), the filter will pop up again. The design is flawed, plain and simple. I do not have a bad device per say, it's just that they did not design the filter housing with effectiveness.",0,6,0,1,"Negative"

"4","Fantastic water filter, and when Brita says ""advanced"" they aren't blowing smoke.I was disenchanted with Brita back in the day - the filters seemed awfully fussy to set up, and they seemed to need changing quite often.  So far I haven't had any issues with these new filters.  Priming it took 15 seconds - no joke - and it was pretty much ready right after priming.  That's to say, I didn't get any black dust or floaties in the first few loads, like I did with the older filters.So I'm back to Brita.  This is a good filter and it does a good job.",0,0,0.5,0.5,"Positive"

Also, I noticed I would get the change light super early. They last a lot longer than the pitcher claims.Pros:*Easy to install.*Works well.*Water doesn't take long to go through the filter.Cons:*NoneAdditional Considerations:Make sure the right filters are bought to fit the size of your pitcher.Overall: 5/5 stars (>=.5 rounds up, <.5 rounds down) => 5 starsIf you have any further questions regarding the product in my review please leave a comment below and I will get back to you as soon as possible.",0,0,0.5,0.5,"Positive"
"6","These are a newer design than the filters I have previously purchased. The new shape makes them easier to grasp and install. You also no longer need to soak the filters prior to use, which I find more convenient. The newer design seems to filter the water much quicker which is great for my family that can go through a pitcher very rapidly. I have also noticed that there aren't any of those unsightly black ""floaters"" in my water anymore.As for the functionality, these filters make my tap water taste much better and remove many of the impurities and toxins. Given the amount of water you can filter, this is not only a much more cost effective solution to bottled water but also more environmentally friendly one.Overall, these are great filters at a reasonable price! I will be purchasing more in the near future.",0,0,0.5,0.5,"Positive"
"7","I love these filters. I drink over a gallon a day and buying water bottles was getting a bit expensive and annoying (having to buy 2 cases a week and then running out without knowing). These are the 2nd set I buy. The first set of 3 lasted me about 4 months. So I would say a month per filter which in my case is great considering I was spending over $20 in water bottles each month. It is very convenient and inexpensive. And I can have cold water everyday without having to remember to put more water bottles in the fridge after I take one.",0,0,0.5,0.5,"Positive"
"8","These Brita filters are an improvement over the old Brita filters. We've used Brita filters for years and I didn't notice when I ordered these that the design has changed a bit. The taste of our water after using these filters is the same as we are used to (the filters remove that chlorine taste that our regular tap water has), but the water filters through quicker, which is nice. I've also noticed there is virtually no black carbon specs slipping into the water pitcher like we had with the old Brita filters. I wasn't looking for a different Brita filter but I'm glad I ordered these and I'll make sure I will get the same kind again the next time I need to reorder.",0,0,0.5,0.5,"Positive"

"12","I use these with my Brita pitcher. As a college student, this is a lifesaver for being able to get clean water in a dorm room without wasting hundreds of plastic bottles a month.  The button on the top of the filter allows for easy installation and replacement. Brita guarantees that Brita brand filters will work in any of their products, and in my experience, this has been the case. The filter uses activated carbon to filter the water.I purchased a three pack for $12 with Prime shipping versus my local store price of $25 dollars for three. They arrived individually wrapped and unharmed in a box. When opened, the filters can be moist because packaged in a way so that they are ready for immediate use.Note: on the instructions that the first one or two pitchers of water should be used to water plants or similar to allow the filter to begin functioning properly.

"13","If you have problems with water in your area and you want to make it better for you kitchen needs this filter water replacements are absolutely great for most of the contaminants in your plumbs. In particular I have to say that without using that filter I always had a precipitate on the bottom and walls of my pan. Now, I do not worry about that et all, using this filters I can cook without bothering to buy spring water or any bottled water from a grocery store.For those who have kids it is absolutely essential to have one of those if you do not have pure water in your area.",0,0,0.5,0.5,"Positive"
"14","Brita filters a great. they work well and last, I have been using Brita for many many years and will continue to do so .  Pre-soaking is no longer required, and a new mesh is meant to prevent carbon flecks from leaking into the water. The flecks were always harmless, but unsightly. That new top is also a lot easier to grab-This filter still does what Brita has always done. Remove chlorine, sediment, zinc to make your water taste better, and reduce various other metallic/toxic contaminants that may be present. It makes tap water taste better, potentially makes the water safer, and costs far less than bottled water. Besides that, filtering is much more environmentally-friendly than bottled water  so your are helping the environment and saving money",0,0,0.5,0.5,"Positive"
"15","We live in Arizona, where the water is awful.  It's hard, and full of minerals and salts from the desert.  We drink only bottled water, but use filtered water to make coffee and tea. We've had a Brita pitcher for several years, and liked it for this purpose. When it was time to change the filter, it was inconvenient to let the filter soak for 15 minutes before putting it in the pitcher. These new filters only need to be rinsed thoroughly under the faucet before use.  The old filters also seemed to leave more charcoal powder in the pitcher than these new ones do.",0,0,0.5,0.5,"Positive"
"16","I was very unhappy when the package arrived because these filters didn't look like the ones I'd been using for years, nor did they look like the ones pictured.  But when I went to use them, I was delighted!  Formerly the water trickled so slowly into the pitcher and you had to wait around to put more in.  With these filters, the water fills up the pitcher SO much more quickly.  One hopes the quality of the water that has gone through the filter is just as good...",0,0,0.5,0.5,"Positive"

Now they made so it's very easy to get out and you do not have to soak it in a glass of water anymore.These filter works great and you can really tell the difference when drinking water. No chlorine taste and no charcoal flakes floating around in the water.Good price great product.I only gave it 4 stars because 5 stars are meant for angels and gods.",0,0,0.5,0.5,"Positive"
"18","Great replacements to use in my counter top container, these work great and are easy to use / replace. They are good for 2 months so this 3 pack is a great buy for me.I am a firm believer that water has a taste, I know it's the stuff in the water that makes it taste different. I love these filters as we have well water that sometimes has some dirt and sediments and these filters clean all of that out so we have great tasting water every time.We go through a lot of drinking water and these filters last the whole 2 months, probably could last longer but we go ahead and change them as recommended.

"19","Absolute waste of money. I have been using my Brita water filter for 10 years and never had a problem with it until I started using these replacement filters. These float out even after being pressed in. I fill the upper reservoir and I see the filter unseat. At other times I am tipping the pitcher to use the filtered water and I hear a ""clunk"" and I know the filter has fallen out.Brita has changed their replacement filter design and it's a few fractions of a millimeter too small, making for a loose fit.",0,0,0.5,0.5,"Positive"
"20","I bought the 3-pack filters elsewhere. However, I found that the new filter style leaked some water down the side of the filter after the install, instead of going through the inside element. After looking at it, I pushed down harder on the replacement filter to seat it correctly. The upper lip of the replacement filter is now just below the lower lip of the housing. That fixed the problem. Now all water exits through the four holes in the filter bottom. The older filters did not require as much elbow grease. Hope this helps those complaining about leaking filters or tap-tasting filtered water. We've enjoyed our Brita for years and I hope it continues to last.",0,0,0.5,0.5,"Positive"
"21","I'm happy with these Brita water filters. They fit my Brita pitcher and the water tastes very clean. The water doesn't take too long to filter through it. I have discovered that I need to leave the pitcher in the sink after filling, without carrying it to the fridge until all of the water has filtered through. Otherwise, carrying the pitcher while it filters occasionally causes the filter to dislodge a little, allowing unfiltered water to pass through very quickly. It would be nice if there was a way to lock it in place. Otherwise, I'm very happy.",0,0,0.5,0.5,"Positive"
"22","Generally a good filter, but they do not seem to fit Brita pitchers as well as the generics. I bought the counter-top dispenser and both the filter that came with it and the first from my replacement order ""pop out"" of their mounts every few days. When that happens, unfiltered water flows straight through into the dispenser, requiring me to dump the (now contaminated) water in the dispenser, disassemble the dispenser, reseat the filter, and refill.Generic filters have a much tighter fit in the dispenser; I have to pull harder to get them out, but they STAY IN.",0,0,0.5,0.5,"Positive"

"24","Needed some filter replacements for our Brita pitchers.  We have 3 in our kitchen so this pack of three was perfect.  I could have easily purchased the same pack at the store for a similar price but the convenience of having these delivered to your day in a few days, with Prime, is what got me.  These are the same filters you would buy at any store and packaged the same way.  At the time I purchased these filters, they were actually cheaper than it was at my local stores so that was a big plus at the time.  Would recommend this to anyone that uses their Brita a lot and needs a more convenient way of getting these filters.",0,0,0.5,0.5,"Positive"
"25","These things may look a bit different from the filter which is included with the purchase of a pitcher, but they will install just as easily and work as effectively. Still recommended to dump your first three pitchers due to carbon dust, though, but given how long these things last, it's hardly an issue. No black flecks in the filtration section due to the improved design, which is nice.Cleanses your water so you won't have to deal with the garbage-taste from the tap. I've only went through one filter as of yet; the average lifetime of the last filter was a little more than two months (for a household of three). I purchased the 3-pack, expecting it to last through half of a year.I highly recommend Brita for your water filtration needs. Easy to install, tastes great, and helps to save the environment one bottle at a time.",0,0,0.5,0.5,"Positive"
"26","These new-style filters are no good.  Sure, they don't require soaking, and the black specks aren't an issue any longer, but these filters are not filtering chlorine like the old style did.  The old ones would yield water I could never smell chlorine in, and the new ones leave a noticeable chlorine smell.  Tried 4 different filters out of the two different multipacks thinking the first was a manufacturing issue, same results each time.It is time to switch brands or finally do a whole-home filter.  Such a shame, Brita had an ardent promoter in me.",0,0,0.5,0.5,"Positive"
"27","I'm basically reviewing the Brita system.  I've tried several of the off brand filters to try and save some money, but the only filters that I have come across that reduce TDS are the Brita brand.  Of course, there is Zero Water which is not an economical solution IMO and also reportedly has reported issues with turning the water acidic before the filter is ""spent"" and is still removing solids.  At any rate, there must be a DI resin in the Brita filters that the generics that I have tried do not have.  And this is the thing that I think is unrealized ... the Brita system does reduce total dissolved solids.  It is not just a particulate and carbon ""taste"" filter.  TDS out of our tap is around 150.  First pass from a new Brita cuts it in half.  Second pass cuts it by about 60% more.  I mix Brita filtered water, half and half, with distilled and need to get the Brita filtered water TDS down into the 30's so that, when mixed with distilled water (0 TDS), the mix is below 20 TDS.  I drink almost nothing but water and my water has to have virtually no taste at all.  Below 20 TDS, the water is taste free to my palate.  My wife drinks water with a little of the flavor that comes in the small squeeze bottles, and she drinks tea.  One pass through the Brita is fine with her.  Between the two of us, we get about 10-14 days from a Brita filter.  No where near 200 gallons, or whatever Brita claims.  But again, I have some strange requirements.  At any rate, 10-14 days is about the time where it takes 4 passes through the filter to be able to get the TDS down low enough for my palate (20 TDS or less, mixed with 1/2 distilled) and it becomes too much of a chore.  Probably not a bad thing to change the filter more often as the pitcher gets cleaned frequently.  The bottom line is that we really aren't saving much money using the Brita system over buying bottled water.  Maybe a few bucks because we don't need to buy spring water for my wife so it's convenient to only have to lug 3 gallon bottles of distilled from the grocery store each week for my finicky palate and no spring water since my wife is good with the Brita.  We haven't tried the PUR or any other system.  And we wont try the Zero Water because of the reported issues with low PH acidic water (sour) and the cost of the filters.  All in all, the Brita system works pretty well for us and the filters don't cost an arm and a leg.  We've been using the Brita for 3 or 4 years now.  There are often good deals here on Amazon for 5 or 6 packs of the filters too.  Not perfect, but a pretty good system for us.",0,0,0.5,0.5,"Positive"
"28","Horrible taste. These Filters could not possibly be real Brita filters. I have bought Brita filters before and I was satisfied with the water that went through the filters but these were so horrible that it is hard to describe! The water tasted putrid. No one would drink the water at our house that came out of these filters. It was that bad. These are fake Brita filters. I had to go to Walmart and buy genuine Brita filters.",0,0,0.5,0.5,"Positive"

I use to buy bottled water however when i moved to a building with stairs it got very inconvenient to carry bottles of water. its been 2 months now and its time to replace the filter which is why i purchased this product. For a little over 13 dollars you get 3 filters which is equivalent to 6 months of clean tasty water without any hassle. Most people drink straight from the tap but with Brita, you can feel 100 times safer knowing this product removes harmful chemicals such as  Mercury copper and cadmium.",0,0,0.5,0.5,"Positive"

Glad I purchased them as they arrived prior to the hurricane and allowed me to filter and store about 10 gallons of water. This was a great safety net to have along with the bottled water we had on hand. We also use the filtered water for coffee in the morning and it makes it taste much better than unfiltered water.",0,0,0.5,0.5,"Positive"
"32","After seeing that over 1600 people gave this 5 stars, I have come to the conclusion that over 1600 have never tasted good water! Why does my water taste worse than tap after I filter it?  If the water sits in the pitcher overnight it tastes and smells like chlorine. I reassure you that it was not just one filter but over 5 of them have done this.  I live in NYC so there is no question about quality, we have the best tasting water in the country.  So why does the Brita filter make it taste so horrible?  I was using the Culligan filters previously but decided to switch to this because the Brita filters the water quicker.  I think I am going to switch back to Culligan and deal with the long filtration process because I need water that tastes like water not bleach.",0,0,0.5,0.5,"Positive"

Using my Brita pitcher and these filters makes it easy to fill up the pitcher with tap water and get clean great tasting water. I have tried to use generic brand filters before, but they really do not compare to these Brita filters. The taste is amazing and they last a long time before needing to be replaced.

"35","I had the Brita UltraMax water filter dispenser system and had to purchase the Brita Water filter refils. However I bought the 3 pack one and totally forgot about it and found out about it a year later when cleaning out our kitchen cabinet.  However, the inside filter is not filtering and when shaking it around you don't hear the typical sandy sound, but more like harden clunks.  I did not know that these types of refils would go back after a while. They are not cheap either, but I guess for better water quality for me and my family I will have to get replacement.",0,0,0.5,0.5,"Positive"

"41","Living in Jacksonville, FL where the tap water is very hard and can sometimes smell of dissolved solids, the Brita filter eliminates most of the unpleasantness and does so for at least 8 weeks of normal use. I use my Brita pitcher to filter water that I use in our office Keurig coffee machine and as I go through a lot of coffee in the course of a week, my Brita pitcher and filter go through a lot of nasty tap water. The product could be improved if it fit the housing a bit tighter; in every fill you can see that some of the water from the reservoir enters the pitcher by channeling around the filter element so ultimately some of the water in the Brita pitcher is actually ""unfiltered."" Aside from the loose tolerances in fit, these filters do the job.",0,0,0.5,0.5,"Positive"

The filters come in a package of three and they last for about three months each, or a total (higher math) nine months. Filter replacement is very intuitive leaving the next replacement date the only thing to remember to insure good tasting water from your tank or pitcher. Whether this item is something you should consider depends on how satisfied you are with the way your water tastes coming out of the tap. Some locations are better than others. Also, if you have a water dispenser on your refrigerator, this is not for you, unless the filters fit in that system.",0,0,0.5,0.5,"Positive"

I really can't tell a huge difference between the old and new, but it seems these are slightly better and keeping the charcoal bits from getting into the water.  Frankly that never bothered me much, because in Japan we would put who pieces of charcoal into our pitchers to make better tasting water so getting charcoal bits was totally normal for me (and let me know the water had been treated too!)A tip: These filters are sold in a variety of pack sizes, but the largest isn't necessarily the best deal.

Or until I grow tired of my kids not refilling the pitcher and putting it back in the fridge and chuck it and go back to using the sink faucet.  At which time I'll probably have at least two of these left and I'll probably keep them around for years because they're perfectly good, so why throw them away?

Once in awhile a small amount of the filter material gets into the water but apparently they have a newly designed filter now to stop that.  Also occasionally the filter material seems to become compacted and thus slow down the filtration flow considerably.  Taking the filter out and tapping in upside down in the sink or on the counter loosens it pretty good to get the flow back to more normal.

We have very hard water in our area, so I used the supplied two filters quickly (each one lasted about 2 months and I filter about 1 1/2 gallons of water a day).  I bought this pack of 6 and the only minus I would give the purchase is that there are no detailed instructions in this packet and the details are important in using the filter correctly.  I had to access the directions for filter use via the Internet. So if you still have your original directions from the pitcher, KEEP THEM. It takes some time for the water to drip through the filter, so do something else while this is happening or you will find yourself taping the counter waiting for the water to completely go through. My water tastes so much better, no Cl smell or taste at all. Overall I like the product.",0,0,0.5,0.5,"Positive"
"57","These new redesigned filters have not worked very well for me. They form a very poor seal in their hole, causing water to leak past the filter constantly. They also like to fall out while I'm pouring, which is quite annoying. It is nice not having to pre-soak them like the old ones, or having tons of charcoal dots floating around in the pre-filter reservoir, but I would much rather they actually worked. I mean really, how much would it cost them to put a small rubber gasket around the rim of the filter. Boom, problem solved. I was able to fix the problem in my case by putting tape around the edge of the hole, so clearly some kind of gasket would work perfectly.All of that aside, they do filter pretty well. If you can get it to stay in, and form a good seal, the water is excellent. The water in my city has a very high chlorine content, and these filter completely remove that taste.Update: after fighting with this stupid thing for 20 minutes, I decided to reduce my review from 2/5 to 1/5.

It fit very well into the filter slot, and it leaked the normal amount of carbon I'm used to seeing.It wasn't until I tried the second round of water that my husband noticed the filtered water tasted a bit more like tap than we are normally used to.

I have run a few pitcher's worth of water through it now and have not run into the floaty issue. I recommend making sure your pitcher is one of the supported ones listed on the page and packaging. Also, making sure your filter is seated properly helps too. Yes, this filter does take longer to filter X amount of water than one of the ""classic"" Brita filters. Considering it has a different design/material than the classic filter in order to filter out the additional contaminants listed, I think its a small trade off. Can't handle that trade off? Go for a normal Brita filter. On that note, filtering a full pitcher's worth of water took under 30 minutes.

"446","I've observed that it's the tree-hugger types that drink lots and lots and lots of bottled water. Think about this. If there are, by a very conservative SWAG estimate, 5 million Americans (or about 1/50th of our population) drinking four 12-ounce bottles of water a day, that's 7,300,000,000 plastic bottles being added to our landfills every year.That's seven billion, three hundred million. If you laid those 7.3 billion bottles end to end, with no gaps between the bottles, that'd be a *really* long line. (According to the Natural Resources Defense Council, about 1/3rd of Americans drink bottled water ""regularly."")My point is, Brita water pitchers and filters have the potential to keep countless billions of plastic bottles out of the waste stream. That's a massive benefit.Now that I'm well into my fifth decade, I drink lots of water each day and I think Brita filters are the best thing since sliced banana nut bread. No kidding. It filters out all kinds of nasty toxins and provides clean, tasty, healthy water - at a FRACTION of the cost of bottled water.Plus, despite the popular criticisms of our municipal water systems, they do provide a good, reliable supply of healthy water. Our generation (baby boomers) may not fully appreciate this, but thanks to water treatment, chlorine and filtration, this country hasn't had a water-borne case of cholera or E. Coli in many decades.Color me skeptical, but I have my doubts about the purity and safety of bottled ""spring water"" that costs 500 times more than tap water.Pouring your tap water (which can contain heavy metals and other nasties) through a Brita filter is the best of all worlds. Cheap water, clean water and healthy water.If I were queen of the world (and it shouldn't be long now), I'd put the bottled water companies out of business and ask folks to turn wholly to filtration systems (such as Brita) to provide clean, pottable water. And re-use those billions of water bottles for brita-purified water.The only thing that'd make Brita better ---> create a new filter that also filters out flouride.

When it was time to change the filter, we bought a 3 count of filters from Amazon.  The first filter worked great but we have since changed and used the last two and with both filters, after one day, our water tasted HORRIBLE!  It had a really strong plastic taste!  We have since thrown all three of these filters away and have started back using bottled water.  Very disappointed!",0,0,0.5,0.5,"Positive"

I have the 10 cup everyday Brita water pitcher that I received as a gift and when the original filter needed to be replaced, I set out looking for replacements at stores.  I almost gave up on the pitcher completely because I didn't want to pay the amount they were charging for replacements.  Then I checked out Amazon and was happy to find that they didn't charge you up the wall for these.  Amazon is the best place I've found to buy replacement filters.As far as quality goes, Brita is top of the line.  The water tastes crisp and fresh, which is a major plus because the tap water normally tastes like metal in the city I live in.  The filters generally only last for about 3 months, but think about how much water you go through in 3 months?

"842","The Brita filters consistently produce drinking water that is better tasting than bottled water at a fraction of the cost and without the use of all the plastic bottles.Regardless of the Brita container used the flow rate through the filter is about the same.  Drinking water, coffee, bourbon and water, and anything with ice tastes better.One of the concerns with the inline filters is that they remove chlorine or other disinfectants from the water on the faucet side of the filter. If not used frequently there is a potential problem for both contamination and picking up the taste from metallic piping systems. Brita cautions that once water is filtered it should be stored in the refrigerator.If you like pure water at an economical price and care enough not to create more plastic bottles this is the system for you.Brita listened to those who thought the original containers were way too large and cumbersome. The new pitchers are great.For the kids cool water from the refrigerator is much better than soft drinks and again a fraction of the cost.I have three of the pitchers (office, home and cabin)  and disposed of my old large container.Highly recommended.",0,0,0.5,0.5,"Positive"

For the last year or two we have seen carbon particles in the bottom of the pitcher and in our glass. The amount of carbon leakage has varied from cartridge to cartridge, but seems to get worse each time we buy a new package of them. The latest package is also deficient in filtering the strong chlorine taste from the tap water. It's very disappointing to see a formerly excellent product deteriorate so dramatically that it has become virtually useless for it's purpose. If the post I read indicating that Brita was acquired by Clorox is correct, I guess this is yet another example of companies with high quality being acquired by larger companies that want to maximize profits by cutting costs.

"1396","I have been using Brita water filters for over 20 years and the taste is better than any bottled water which costs significantly more. I live in New Jersey and my tap water tastes horrible. I drink a lot of water and use Brita not only for home but always have one or two water bottles in the car filled with Brita. I just don't understand how people can go out and buy bottled water when they can get better quality and better tasting water for significantly less. In the past 20+ years I have used about 5 or 6 different pitchers and it fit all of them perfectly. I go through one filter ever two months which adds up to about $1 week - I never buy soda and only drink Brita water, fresh juice from my juicer, and a morning mug of coffee - good coffee requires freshly ground quality beans and good, clean water.Water is good to hydrate and flush out your system. Stop buying soda, and stop spending money on bottled water. Get one of these babies and a few good water bottles to take your brita water with you. Just make sure you change the filter and let new filters soak as directed. If you want to add taste then add a piece lemon.",0,0,0.5,0.5,"Positive"

"1889","As a cruise ship employee, I don't have luxury of home appliances and access to many things other people take for granted. One of them is a source of clean, fresh water.yeah, ships do have a water treatment plant but all the water onboard is HEAVILY chlorinated and if you drink it out of the tap, trust me, you won't feel so good. So, for years i was buying bottled water until I saw one of shipboard officers using Brita water pitcher with filter. Long story short, I got one too.Boy, what a change!For once I don't have to shell out a bunch of money for bottled water. Second, instead of running up and down and waiting for ship's store to open, I have fresh water right in my own room! And finally, it takes LESS space than a set of dozen bottles!I was worried about black particles that people talk about but so far, I had no problems with that. Several of them is floating in upper tank but filtered water is blissfully free of any impurities.I have to say that I'm extremely happy with this purchase and I will buy more filters and additional pitchers for my home too, especially since me and my lady are expecting a second child now and you can never be too cautious about water quality!Thanks Brita!",0,0,0.5,0.5,"Positive"

"2086","I have both a PUR filter on my faucet and 2 Brita Pitchers. My wife and I both agree the Brita is the better of the two. Not sure why, the PUR seems to be designed with a more in depth filter, but the Brita water has a distinctive neutral taste that you expect from water. I have a good source from a deep well, but Iron Bacteria is a problem, and the Brita does a great job of filtering any odd taste out. Highly recommended. Ignore the bits of charcoal that float up, they never get through, and it seems it is just a part of the fine charcoal filter package. They do last the advertised time, and it seems a lot better way to do it, than to have mega piles of empty plastic bottles, and you don't have to worry about plastic chemical leaching into the water you're drinking.

You put in your tap water with a bad after taste, and it comes out tasting like water should... like nothing!They don't filter everything; they don't purify (kill bacteria), but they sure do make the water taste good and take out much of the harmful additives.Also, they are cheap compared to buying water and don't cause nearly as much waste as bottled water.  They also save energy because they do not use massive amounts of fuel (truck or human!) for hauling.Besides, you know most bottled waters are from the ta anyway, don't you?The 5-pack is a discounted version of the single-pack, without the price commitment of the larger packs.",0,0,0.5,0.5,"Positive"

I was a little worried that if I paid less for the filters that they would some how be faulty or defective but that wasn't the case.  I've used one of the three and it works just as well as the others I have purchased in Walmart or Target.  Change it at least every two months or more if you go through pitchers of water.  My Brita pitcher has an indicator on it that helps me know when to change it but after awhile you can taste the difference and know that it's time to change filters.

I've had these pitchers before, but something happened to it and I'm glad I eventually bought another.

It also causes some smaller active carbon particles leak into the filtered water.I have purchased other filters before and it never happened. I am wondering whether the shipping is not handled properly and the filters are pressed out of shape a little.4/11/2013 Follow upMy husband played with the filters and accidentally found that you have to push very hard in order to seal the filter.I used to just push it a little bit and it worked for most filters.

"2647","With so many of these filters popping out on the market,one has to be careful as to where to shop for an important product such as water filter,if you don't shop from a trusted company,you would never know what do they really pack those filters with!!Brita is a household name that we known for many years and they have a good reputation for excellent products and this one is no exception!I've tried the drug store brand before and it just not the same! There will always be an after taste to the filtered water,whereas with the Brita filters I never have that problem,water tastes tasteless,which is what you look for in filtered water.I highly recommend these Brita Filters and out of experience not just a passerby's testimony.

But it is hit or miss.I usually replace my filter every 3 months, so I should be good for another year with this pack.I even keep an extra smaller 5 cup pitcher that I got at Walmart for $10 bucks (with a filter).The reason I gave these filters 4 stars is because when I opened the one it had the black charcoal specks all over in the wrapper. I never had this problem before. It still seemed fine and I am of course going to use it but I thought it was worth mentioning.

"2800","I am fortunate to live in a city known for its good water, but that water can arrive at the tap after lengthy travels through lead piping. Further, if it rains heavily where your city's water storage is, your water can be clouded.Enter the Brita Water Filter Pitcher, in all its phases. This filter removes cloudiness, as well as that awful metallic taste, and leaves water as fresh and, well, water-flavored as you might wish. There's nothing now in it to interfere with realizing the full flavor of coffee or tea, or reduce the deliciousness of a tall chilled glass of it right after exercise.If you boil your water for a reason OTHER than killing micro-organisms, consider this: by doing so you are concentrating metallic particles. If you do boil your water, filter it after.I've seen an Instructable for ""refilling"" these: sorry, but that doesn't work. It uses only activated charcoal, which will not remove the metallic bits & pieces you want to avoid (you really do).Want to feel good? Cough up for a pitcher and filter. Replace it as often as you need to. It's a great investment in your health.",0,0,0.5,0.5,"Positive"

"2804","Ok, the filters are pretty good and cost effective so it's worth some trouble to use them.  And Brita is plenty of trouble.  They have poor management and poor quality control, so here's the trouble you will have to contend with:  1.  the directions for replacing filters are wrong -- you do not drop them into the hole, they only fit at one angle so you must gently rotate them until you find the right fit, then slide down into the hole (but don't forget that they don't actually screw in or when u go to replace a filter u will try to turn it to remove it and it won't turn once seated -- better to tap from bottom to loosen);  2.  the lid to the pitcher (into which this fits) is poorly made and does not fit so it will keep falling off unless you hold it;  once the lid falls off, the filter can pop out and fall into the sink if you are emptying the pitcher all the way.  In short, the Brita system seems to work well enough for a reasonable price, but the company has general distain for customers so they don't fix well known, long standing problems.  If u can live with the problems, the system will probably work for you.  BTW, filters come in 3, 4, 6, 10 packs.  Oddly, cost per unit is best in the 3 pack (as of now).",0,0,0.5,0.5,"Positive"

Although next time I'm getting the four-pack, then they're only $5 each.A note, I have used Pur filters in the past, which yield slightly better tasting water if you are very picky. But Pur takes longer to pass through the filter, costs a bit more, and reviews of the latest models mention several problems, implying that they stop filtering water altogether after a certain period, and might be designed for planned obsolescence so you have to buy replacements more frequently. Someone cut open a filter that had stopped working and noticed white pellets had expanded to block water flow.If this is the case it's a low move on Pur's part, bec different houses and regions will have different levels of impurities, so a filter that might last just 40 gallons in one house might last 80 gallons in a house with a cleaner water supply, so to make the filters stop working after exactly 40 gallons isn't cool. Until Pur fixes this, I'm sticking with Brita.",0,0,0.5,0.5,"Positive"

But I don't need their stinking gauge. I can tell by drinking the stinking water. The filters really do work. I'm not sure what all they remove, technically speaking, but I do know they make the water taste better. Then, I took the pH tester from my kid's aquarium kit and tested both the tap water and the water from the Brita Max. The tap water tested very alkaline, and the Brita water tested 7.0 - which is what pure water should test at.I'm convinced. Now.",0,0,0.5,0.5,"Positive"

I replace the filters when the indicator on top says to do so, about every 2 months. and they're easy to change.

Note, this is not going into what I drink, the other way around. When I fill it up with water, there is a top half (reservoir) that slowly allows water to flow through the filter and down into the bottom half. It's the reservoir that is filling up inexplicably with this stuff. I rinse it out and it keeps coming. But as long as it doesn't get into my drink, I suppose I can't complain.

Used to fill a large cup with water, set the filter in it and walk away for a time. Would even tap on the cup to work the air out of the old filters. This new one, rinse it off and drop it in.The water also passes through faster. I see here a lot of concern about this and people seem to think the filter is either defective or not placed in the pitcher correctly. Well with the dispensers I have, the filter will only fit in one way as there is a notch on them that a tab on the dispenser that fits into it. And they all seemed to be seating in fine. I have even gone so far as to watch closely and see that the water is pouring out the holes in the bottom of the filter and NOT going around it. I think it is just part of the improved design. They also seem to weigh less than old design so that may have something to do with it. Other water filters work without slowing the water down, why can't these.",0,0,0.5,0.5,"Positive"

I drink Zepherhills bottled water.  And I love my coffee.  We have city water.  So I did some REAL taste test with my morning coffee.  The Brita made a far more smoother cup of coffee.  A marked difference over Pur.  I will never go back to Pur for my coffee making.  Brita has much more charcoal for taste/odor filtering.  So you see it in the first pitcher with a new filter.  Yes, I have to discard the first pitcher of water after inserting a new filter.  Big Deal, it is worth the taste.  Note that the filter brands will generally interchange between brands of pitchers.  Brita all the way, and don't look back.",0,0,0.5,0.5,"Positive"

When I ordered these I received my box of filters and popped one into the Brita pitcher and it worked great. The next one I put in seemed to run slow. I left water in the top reservoir and came back to it a half hour later to find barely any of the water had run through. I figured ok, a bad filter. It happens. I put another filter from the box in (Yes, I followed the instruction and soaked both filters as described on the package and as I have done every time I put a new filter in) and same story. A little bit of the water ran through after an agonizingly long period of time but it eventually completely stopped. My wife said it was because these were generic filters and not Brita brand products. Needless to say this is the last time I purchase these filters. I'm gonna stick with the name brand.",0,0,0.5,0.5,"Positive"

There are also larger quantity packages with even more savings. I have used only one filter so far, and it worked even better that the filter that came with the pitcher. What I mean is that you must rinse the filter before inserting it in the pitcher. Once inserted, you may see some small particles of charcoal on the pitcher bottom. While it is not a health issue, Brita recommends dumping the water and filtering a new batch, until the water is clear. When I rinsed this replacement filter, and inserted it, I did not get any charcoal dust at all. Maybe it was luck, but that is the way it turned out. If you are going to use a Brite appliance, use the proper filter. But, read the package sizes when you do, to get the price that pleases you the most.",0,0,0.5,0.5,"Positive"

"3982","Nov. 2012: I've used these filters in the Brita pitcher for years, and the filtered water tastes much better than local water, which has high chemical taste. However, the last two filters have run the water through at high speed - very different from usual slow filtering. I actually threw away a filter thinking it was faulty, but the next one from same package did the same thing. The filters aren't cheap, and I'm wondering about checking with the company about this. First I'd like to know if anyone else has had this problem recently. (I see there were some complaints of this in 2010). Thanks for any replies.",0,0,0.5,0.5,"Positive"

"4098","Fine for me; others may feel they need more filtration. They are a SO NEEDED alternative to bottled water, which steals valuable water from snow melt when we are in the 4th year of a drought here in the Central Valley Valley of California.When the largest food producing area of our country has less or no water for irrigation it will certainly open many eyes and pocketbooks for higher prices on just about every product grown and shipped from here to locations all over the country. If they do have product it could be from places much less careful about human safety from pesticides and poor handling conditions. Like many of the less expensive products, they may they may also employ children and others in squalid conditions. (Not to say we are completely free of owners doing that here, and I do not mean just illegals.) We should use the resources we have for these menial positions..a great job to keep prisoners going something besides sitting around, using gyms, libraries, etc. THAT IS NOT PUNISHMENT. THEY CAN READ, LEARN AND EXERCISE AFTER WORK LIKE THE REST OF US, having illegals overcrowding our prisons is outrageous..ILLEGAL HAS ONLY ONE DEFINITION..not legal to be here, especially with room, board, perks and health care that many of our CITIZENS do not receive.uAnd back to those plastic bottles, they are also clogging our lakes, streams and there are huge deposited in our oceans.

"4307","My husband primarily uses the Brita pitcher at work instead of drinking out of the drinking fountains or tap water from the sink.  We recently went on a road trip and decided to take it with us.  It was a little slow to filter the water, but the water always tasted great and it saved us from having to buy and carry a supply of plastic water bottles or constantly be filling up our water bottles at the rest stop fountains.  We even used it to filter the water at the place we stayed.  There is one caveat to these filters though, we had to constantly keep water in it so that it would not dry out.  That wasn't really a problem though as we were constantly using it.  Great, refreshing taste at a fraction of the cost it would have cost us for bottled water!",0,0,0.5,0.5,"Positive"

"4779","I've been using conventional Brita filters for my Brita pitcher at work for several years. I teach at a college, so typically I'll change the filter at the beginning of every semester. The Brita Longlast is supposed to give me 300% more filtering time, which would mean only changing once every 1.5 years at work. This sounds almost too good to be true, but we shall see. So far so good. Another advantage, is that this filter has a more robust filtering system. It's purported to reduce more contaminants, including 99% of lead. For home use, this filter is supposed to be changed every 120 gallons, which for a family is about 6 months. So far it seems worth the extra investment for a ""heavy duty"" filter.

"4980","Have used Brita water filters before, so the result was just expected. Where I live, the water is very hard... a tiny drop of water when dried up will always leave a white circle.

"4995","I ordered the pitcher and these replacement filters to go with 6 months ago. The canister came with a filter so I put the other filters away. They have been  sitting in the closet for the last 6 months Well, today I opened the box and the first filterwas defective but I needed one so  I opened another one and come to find out after the third one that all three were bent so they can't fit into the space provided for them and they had charcoal carbon all inside of the individual packages because it had spilled out due to the bend and not being sealed. I can't use any of them and we are out of filters. The box  was a little crushed when I received it, but not enough that I would think anything had happened to the filters. I wrote a letter to Amazon telling them I am not looking for money back, just  for good filters. They said  ""I apologize for the issues with your order and promise that we strive to do everything in our power to make our customers happy. Unfortunately, we support a 30 day return policy and, as of today, your order was placed (180) days ago. While we are unable to accept your return, I suggest contacting the manufacturer of the product to see if the product is under warranty and if you can receive a replacement. Again, I apologize and I wish that there was more I could do for you in this situation. Please let me know if you need anything else and have a wonderful day.""
